This piece of software helps to tell interactive stories inside Excalidraw, using its feature to link elements and navigate between them.

It basically converts a plain-text story file (where every line is a storypoint) to an .excalidraw sketch-file.

If you have no clue what this may mean, try one of the adventures I created:

(change to view mode upon opening for the best experience)

Current version on master is the minimum viable software, meaning it works, but there is much to improve!
(Maybe you wanna help by contributing?)

One feature I really (really, really) would like to have, is that the drawing opens in view mode.
Want to find a way that doesn't use third party apps and doesn't require customizing Excalidraw for this purpose.
